# TaskManagerApp

The Task Manager is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. It provides features like task details, priority settings, and task notifications.

Installation
To run the Task Manager, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/. The Task Manager utilizes the Tkinter library, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

After installing Python, you can follow these steps to run the Task Manager:

Download the Task Manager code files from GitHub.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the code files are extracted.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install tkcalendar

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the Task Manager:

python task_manager.py

The Task Manager application window will open, and you can start managing your tasks.

Features
Add Task
To add a new task, click on the "Add Task" button. A new window will open, where you can enter the task details such as task name, deadline, priority, and description. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the task list.

View Task Details
To view the details of a task, select a task from the task list and click the "View Details" button. A window will open, displaying the task details, including the task name, deadline, priority, and description.

Edit Task
To edit a task, select a task from the task list and click the "Edit" button. A new window will open, where you can modify the task details. Make the desired changes and click the "Save" button to update the task.

Delete Task
To delete a task, select a task from the task list and click the "Delete" button. A confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the deletion. Click the "Yes" button to delete the task.

Task Prioritization
When adding or editing a task, you can assign a priority level to it using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest priority and 5 is the highest priority. This helps in organizing tasks based on their importance.

Task Notifications
The Task Manager provides a notification system to alert users about approaching or overdue tasks. When the application starts, it checks for any tasks with past deadlines and displays a notification in a pop-up window if such tasks are found.

Data Persistence
The Task Manager saves the tasks to a file named "tasks.txt" in the application's directory. This allows the tasks to be persisted between different sessions of running the application.

File Structure
The Task Manager project consists of the following files:

task_manager.py: The main Python script containing the TaskManagerApp class and the application logic.
tasks.txt: The file where the tasks are stored.
README.md: Documentation file with instructions on how to run the Task Manager.

Future Enhancements
The Task Manager can be further improved by implementing additional features and functionality, such as:

Task filtering and sorting based on different criteria like priority, date, or name.
Task search functionality to quickly find specific tasks.
User authentication and user-specific task management.
Task categories or labels for better task organization.
Reminders or notifications via email, SMS, or other means.
Integration with cloud services or task management platforms.
These enhancements can be implemented by extending the existing codebase and adding the necessary features.

Conclusion
The Task Manager provides a basic yet useful interface for managing tasks. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities, and receive notifications for approaching or overdue tasks. With further enhancements, it can become a more comprehensive task management solution.
